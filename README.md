## Overview

This game library code project is built using Java and Spring Boot, providing a RESTful API for managing video game information. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete game entries, as well as search for games by various criteria like title and genre. The project also includes user management, where users can create accounts and associate games with their profiles.

## Features

- **Game Management:** Users can add, update, and delete game entries. Game details include title, platform, genre, release year, status, rating, developers, play mode, and designer.

- **User Management:** Users can create accounts, and each user can have their own library of games.

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for games by title, platform, and genre.

## Getting Started
